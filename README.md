ABSTRACT


This thesis analyses the dynamics of small complex objects such as fibers or spheroids when they interact with a turbulent random environment. Our aim is to gain physical understanding on how turbulent fluctuations affect the dynamics of non-spherical particles, inducing phenomena as preferential concentration, deformation or catastrophic events as their fragmentation. Such understanding allows us to propose stochastic parametrisation of violent events that could in principle be used in industrial codes.
